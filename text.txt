According to old Ethiopian stories, \ coffee was discovered 1,000 years ago \ by a farmer \ called Kaldi. \ One day Kaldi noticed \ that his animals were very lively and excited. \ He realised \ that they were eating the small red fruit \ growing on the trees on the hillside. \ He decided to try them himself, \ and when he did \ he liked the taste \ and the good feeling of energy \ that followed. \ He put some of them \ in his pocket \ and went home to tell his wife. \ She said \ the beans must have been sent \ from heaven \ and that Kaldi must take them \ to the monks in the temple. \ The monks said \ the beans were the work of the devil, \ and threw them into the fire. \ Soon the wonderful smell \ of roasting coffee beans \ filled the temple. \ The roasted beans were rescued \ from the fire \ and the monks poured boiling water \ over them to stop the smell. \ That night the monks sat up late, \ drinking the wonderful liquid \ that they had discovered. \
Another version of the story is \ that the monks used to eat the beans \ to keep awake \ during their long nights of prayer. \ Kaldi and the monks lived \ in an area of Ethiopia \ called Kaffa and \ that is where the name coffee originated. \
Today coffee is \ the world’s second most popular drink \ after tea \ and Ethiopia continues to produce \ some of the finest coffee beans \ in the world. \ Today in Kaffa, \ a large proportion of the coffee \ grows wild in the forests \ and on the hills \ and the coffee industry employs \ over twelve million khhpeople. \
As well as being an export earner \ for Ethiopia, \ making and drinking coffee \ is an important social custom \ when entertaining guests \ in an Ethiopian home. \ The process starts \ with the dried green beans. \ These are roasted \ over a small wood fire, \ continuously stirred by the woman \ of the house \ and giving off a delicious smell. \ After the beans turn a very dark brown, \ they are ground \ and the coffee is prepared \ in a special coffee pot. \ The coffee is served in small cups \ with sugar or sometimes salt. \ It is traditional \ to be served three small cups. \
Coffee prepared this way \ is absolutely delicious \ but it’s not only the taste \ that is important. \ It is the occasion. \ Coffee is the time \ for talking, relaxing, forgetting \ about the worries of life \ or discussing them \ with friends,  neighbours and family. \
